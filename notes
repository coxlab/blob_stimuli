Object B
------

b.stl is rotated (in meshlab) with respect to b.blend in the following order:
 - about Z axis = +180 degrees
 - about X axis = +50 degrees


Unit Models
------

b_unit.stl and a_unit.stl are scaled & centered versions of a.stl and b.stl

- Bounding box is centered at origin (Normals, Curvature ... -> Transform: Move, Translate, Center)
- Bounding box is unit scaled (Normals, Curvature ... -> Transform: Scale)
